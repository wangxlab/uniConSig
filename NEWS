Changes in version 0.99.13 (2019-01-05)
+ I uploaded "preCal.data.rda" to Data folder. So, users don't need to download "preCal.data"
+ I deleted "get_data_uniConSigPreCal()" function in "uniConSig_usingPreCal_functionalized.R."  This function is not necessary any more.
+ I deleted this function's namespace
+ I revised vignettes accordingly.
+ I revised "seq" to "seq_along" in "uniConSig_usingPreCal_functionalized.R" file. 
+ I blocked "library(vegan) in line 28 as it causes error in BiocCheck for a certain reason.
