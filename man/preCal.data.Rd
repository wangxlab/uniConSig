\title{pre-calculated penalization factors and molecular concepts coefficients}
\format{A list of characters. Each element contains information for a single <br>
gene in a tab delimited format. After splitting, the first <br>
element is Entrez Gene ID, the second one is a penalization factor <br>
used in uniConSig, the rest are the molecular concepts which are <br>
related to this gene and their coefficients.}
